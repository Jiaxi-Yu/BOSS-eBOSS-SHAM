multinest run in multiple nodes:

************************************
the 1st run:0522 (only for code tests)
************************************
1. reload mpi4py3.1.0 to make sure pymultinest can run on multiple nodes. 
2. use Vpeak and precut LRG by V<160km/s and ELG by V<80km/s
3. use the 1scat 1cut model for both ELG and LRG:

4. all the posteriors are double peaks: 2nd run investigate whether it is caused by precut or 1cut (use LRG)
5. LRG-SGC and ELG-NGC match the iminuit result mainly due to their large error bars

************************************
the 2nd run:0523 & 0523-1(producing the results.)
************************************
1. iminuit: function the same as multinest; no precut; nseeds: 15*2; bestfit plots (prob & halo numbers)
   calculate HAM-bestfit.py(1scat1cut); 
2. multinest: function the same as multinest; no precut; nseeds: 10*2; bestfit plots (prob & halo numbers)
   calculate HAM-MCMC.py(1scat1cut);;
3. LRGmodel.py(1scat0cut)& LRGmodel-MCMC.py(1scat0cut) are discarded because the small number density of LRG
   (results in a large scattering, thus a poor fitting of monopole and still poor quadrupole)

aim:
1. check iminuit & multinest consistency
2. check the fitting goodness
1. compare: no-pre+1cut vs pre+1cut(the effect of precut)

**************************************
the 3rd_run: redirect to comparison 3rd_run
**************************************
the same as 2nd run, but change the LRG observation to PIP weighted and change its prior to [500,1200]
should print multinest chi2 somewhere.
