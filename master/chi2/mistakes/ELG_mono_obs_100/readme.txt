ELG monopole's amplitude is ~50, so the 'observation' near 100 is 
not appropriate.

But actually I just want to see the effects of those three parameters.

Note: v_max bound should not exceed 1000, otherwise v_max and sigma_high
cannot statistically contribute to the correlation function because they only
filtered a few galaxies.
