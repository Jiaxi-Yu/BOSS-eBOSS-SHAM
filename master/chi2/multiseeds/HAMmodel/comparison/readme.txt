cmparison between the multinest and iminuit results:

1st_plot:
1. separated plots for multinest & iminuit
2. plot multinest with the mean values instead of the maximum likelihood values


2nd_plot:
1. combined multinest & iminuit
2. use the maximum likelihood values of multinest

3rd_plot:
1. change LRG prior and observation.
2. print the chi2 for both Multinest and iminuit for comparison

4th_plot:
1. change ELG prior [0,1] [100,500]
2. print the chi2 for both Multinest and iminuit for comparison

5th_plot:
1. change ELG prior[0,1.5] [0,600] 
2. plot 3rd_plot LRG with different z bins
