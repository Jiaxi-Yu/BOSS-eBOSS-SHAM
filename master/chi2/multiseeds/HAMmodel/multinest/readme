multinest run in multiple nodes:

************************************
the 1st run:0522
************************************
1. reload mpi4py3.1.0 to make sure pymultinest can run on multiple nodes. 
2. use Vpeak and precut LRG by V<160km/s and ELG by V<80km/s
3. use the 1scat 1cut model for both ELG and LRG:

4. all the posteriors are double peaks: 2nd run investigate whether it is caused by precut or 1cut (use LRG)
5. LRG-SGC and ELG-NGC match the iminuit result mainly due to their large error bars

************************************
the 2nd run:0523
************************************
1. compare LRG NGC&SGC: no-pre+1cut vs pre+1cut(the effect of precut)
2. compare LRG NGC&SGC: no-pre+1cut vs no-pre+0cut(the effect of 1cut for LRG)
