# SubHalo Abundance Matching including Observational Systemtics
This is a repository to implement the SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM) including observational systemtics on UNIT simulation. The aim is to reproduce the clustering of BOSS/eBOSS LRGs. The project includes the parallel calculation in multiple threads and multiple nodes. We also use the Multinest for the Monte Carlo nested sampling.
